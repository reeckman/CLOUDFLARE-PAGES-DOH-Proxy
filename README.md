# Detailed Steps Instructions

## 1. Fork to Your Own Repository
First, you need to create your own copy of the original project. The steps are as follows:
- Visit the original projectâ€™s GitHub repository page.
- Click the "Fork" button in the upper-right corner to fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
- After forking, you will see the repository under your GitHub account.

## 2. Link Cloudflare Pages to GitHub for Deployment
Next, you need to link your GitHub repository with Cloudflare Pages and deploy the project. The steps are as follows:
- Log in to your Cloudflare account and go to the Cloudflare Pages section.
- Click the "Create a Project" button in the upper-right corner.
- In the pop-up window, select GitHub as the version control service.
- Authorize Cloudflare to access your GitHub repositories and select the repository you forked earlier.
- Follow the prompts to complete the configuration and choose the deployment settings. Cloudflare Pages will automatically read your repository, build, and deploy it.

## 3. Set the DOH_SERVERS Variable
After Cloudflare Pages has deployed the project, you need to set the DOH_SERVERS environment variable. The steps are as follows:
- In the Cloudflare Pages dashboard, find your project and click into the project settings page.
- Select the "Environment Variables" section.
- Create a new environment variable with the name `DOH_SERVERS` and set its value to the address of your own DoH (DNS over HTTPS) server. You can use multiple DoH servers separated by commas. For example:
```bash
  https://dns.google/dns-query, https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query, https://dns.quad9.net/dns-query
```
- After setting this, the system will automatically poll these DoH servers and prioritize using the fastest responding server.

## 4. Use Cloudflare Pages Domain or Custom Domain + /dns-query Path
Once the deployment is complete, you can use the default domain provided by Cloudflare Pages or your own custom domain for DNS queries. Usage is as follows:
- Default domain: `https://your-cloudflare-pages-name.pages.dev/dns-query`
- Custom domain: If your custom domain is `yourdomain.com`, then the access method would be `https://yourdomain.com/dns-query`
- You can append the `/dns-query` path to the domain to perform DNS queries.
