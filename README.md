✅ **Click** the `Fork` button in the upper-right corner to fork the repository to your own GitHub account.  
✅ After forking, you will see the repository under your GitHub account.

---

## 2️⃣ Link Cloudflare Pages to GitHub for Deployment

✅ **Log in** to your Cloudflare account and go to the Cloudflare Pages section.  
✅ **Click** `Create a Project` in the upper-right corner.  
✅ **Select** GitHub as the version control service.  
✅ **Authorize** Cloudflare to access your GitHub repositories and select the repository you forked.

## 3️⃣ Set the DOH_SERVERS Variable

✅ **In Cloudflare Pages dashboard**, find your project and go to project settings.  
✅ **Select** `Environment Variables`.  
✅ **Create** a new variable named `DOH_SERVERS` and set its value to the DoH server addresses. Example:
```bash
  https://dns.google/dns-query, https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query, https://dns.quad9.net/dns-query
```
✅ **Save** the settings. The system will automatically poll the DoH servers and use the fastest responding one.

## 4️⃣ Use Cloudflare Pages Domain or Custom Domain + /dns-query Path

✅ **Default domain**: `https://your-cloudflare-pages-name.pages.dev/dns-query`  
✅ **Custom domain**: If your domain is `yourdomain.com`, access it via `https://yourdomain.com/dns-query`  
✅ **Ensure** `/dns-query` is appended to perform DNS queries.
